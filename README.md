## How to selfhost Simply Tweeted

Simply Tweeted can be easily self-hosted using Docker. You have two options for the database: use an existing MongoDB instance or self-host MongoDB alongside the application.

### Quick Start (Using External MongoDB)

**üí° Tip**: You can use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) which offers a free tier, perfect if you don't want to self-host MongoDB.

#### 1. Create X Developer Application

First, you'll need to create an X (Twitter) developer application to get your API credentials. Follow the detailed guide in the [Setting Up X (Twitter) Developer Application](#setting-up-x-twitter-developer-application) section below.

#### 2. Pull the Docker Image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/timotme/simplytweeted:latest
```

#### 3. Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file with your configuration:

```bash
# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret_key # Generate with `openssl rand -base64 64`
AUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com # Your public domain
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true

# Database
DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key_for_tokens # Generate with `openssl rand -base64 64`
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://username:password@your-mongodb-host:27017/simplyTweeted

# Twitter API
AUTH_TWITTER_ID=your_twitter_client_id
AUTH_TWITTER_SECRET=your_twitter_client_secret

# Security
ALLOWED_TWITTER_ACCOUNTS=your_twitter_username,another_username # Comma-separated list

# Host Settings
ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com # Full URL as seen in browser
PORT=3000
```

#### 4. Run the Container

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name simply-tweeted \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --env-file .env \
  ghcr.io/timotme/simplytweeted:latest
```

### Complete Self-Hosted Setup (Including MongoDB)

If you want to self-host MongoDB as well, use the provided Docker Compose configuration:

#### 1. Get the Docker Compose Files

```bash
# Download the docker-compose.yml and environment template
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timotme/SimplyTweeted/main/deployment/prod/self-hosted/docker-compose.yml
```

#### 2. Create Environment File

Create a `.env.docker` file in the same directory:

```bash
# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret_key # Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
AUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true

# Database (for self-hosted MongoDB)
DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key_for_tokens # Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:example@mongo:27017/simplyTweeted

# Twitter API
AUTH_TWITTER_ID=your_twitter_client_id
AUTH_TWITTER_SECRET=your_twitter_client_secret

# Security
ALLOWED_TWITTER_ACCOUNTS=your_twitter_username,another_username

# Host Settings
ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com
PORT=3000
```

#### 3. Start the Services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start both MongoDB and Simply Tweeted. The application will be available on port 3000, and MongoDB will be accessible on port 27018 (mapped from internal 27017).

### Important Notes

- **Twitter API Setup**: Make sure to configure your Twitter App's OAuth callback URL to match your domain
- **Security**: Use strong, randomly generated secrets for `AUTH_SECRET` and `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- **Firewall**: Only expose port 3000 to the internet; keep MongoDB port (27018) internal
- **Backup**: Regular database backups are recommended for production use
- **SSL**: Use a reverse proxy (like Nginx) with SSL certificates for production deployments

### Production Considerations

For production deployments, consider:
- Using a reverse proxy (Nginx/Traefik) with SSL termination
- Setting up automated backups for MongoDB

cd deployment/dev
docker-compose up -d
```


#### 4. Environment Setup

Create the same environement file in the `scheduler` and `simply-tweeted-app` package:

**Create `.env`:**
```bash
# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret_key # Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Base URL for authentication callbacks

# Database
DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key_for_tokens # Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:your_secure_password@localhost:27017/simplyTweeted

# Twitter API
AUTH_TWITTER_ID=your_twitter_client_id
AUTH_TWITTER_SECRET=your_twitter_client_secret

# Security
ALLOWED_TWITTER_ACCOUNTS=your_twitter_username,another_username # List of account allowed to access the scheduler separated by a comma

# Host setting
ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 # Full URL as seen in the browser
PORT=3000 # Port on which the web app will be exposed
```


#### 5. Build Shared Library

```bash
npm run build --workspace=shared-lib
```

#### 6. Start Development Servers
This will run the front-end.
```bash
npm run dev --workspace=simply-tweeted-app
```
This will run the scheduler once
```bash
npm run dev runOnce  --workspace=tweet-poster-service
```

## Setting Up X (Twitter) Developer Application

To use Simply Tweeted, you'll need to create an X (Twitter) developer application to get the required API credentials. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Apply for X Developer Access

1. **Visit the X Developer Portal**: Go to [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.x.com)
2. **Sign in**: Use your X (Twitter) account credentials
3. **Apply for Access**: Click "Apply" and select "Professional" use case
4. **Fill out the Application**: 
   - Describe your intended use (e.g., "Personal tweet scheduling application")
   - Explain how you'll use the Twitter API
   - Agree to the Developer Agreement and Policy

### 2. Create a New App

Once your developer account is approved:

1. **Navigate to the Developer Portal**: Go to your [developer dashboard](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard)
2. **Create a New Project**: Click "Create Project"
3. **Project Details**:
   - **Name**: Simply Tweeted (or your preferred name)
   - **Use Case**: Choose "Making a bot" or "Building tools for yourself"
   - **Environment**: Select "Development" for testing or "Production" for live use

### 3. Configure Your App

1. **App Settings**: Click on your newly created app
2. **App Permissions**: 
   - Set to **"Read and write"** (required for posting tweets)
   - Enable **"Request email address from users"** if you want email access
3. **Authentication Settings**:
   - **App Type**: Set to "Web App"
   - **Callback URLs**: Add your domain callback:
     ```
     https://your-domain.com/auth/callback/twitter
     ```
     For local development, also add:
     ```
     http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/twitter
     ```
   - **Website URL**: Add your application's URL (this is not important)

### 4. Generate OAuth 2.0 Credentials

Simply Tweeted uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. You only need the OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret:

1. **User Authentication Settings**: In your app settings, click "Set up" in the OAuth 2.0 section
2. **OAuth 2.0 Settings**:
   - **App Type**: Select "Confidential client"
   - **Client ID**: This becomes your `AUTH_TWITTER_ID`
   - **Client Secret**: This becomes your `AUTH_TWITTER_SECRET`

**Note**: You don't need the older API Key and API Secret - Simply Tweeted only uses OAuth 2.0 credentials.

### Important Notes

- **Rate Limits**: Free tier has limited API calls per day/months. ~ 17 scheduled posts per 24h
- **Security**: Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control
- **Callback URLs**: Must exactly match your domain (including https/http)

### Common Issues

- **Callback URL Mismatch**: Ensure your `AUTH_URL` environment variable matches the callback URL in your X app
- **Permission Denied**: Verify your app has "Read and write" permissions
- **Invalid Credentials**: Double-check your `AUTH_TWITTER_ID` and `AUTH_TWITTER_SECRET`

For more detailed information, visit the [X API documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs).
